# Localization

If you would like to translate the extension to your language, simply follow these steps:

1. Go to the `lib/i18n` directory.
2. Create a new JSON file with the same name pattern as `strings_X.i18n.json`, replacing X with the code of your language.
3. Copy the content of the `strings.i18n.json` file.
4. Paste the copied content into your newly created file.
5. Replace the strings with their translated counterparts.
6. Comment on the changes and make a pull request.
